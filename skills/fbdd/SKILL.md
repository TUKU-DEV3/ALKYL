# Fragment-Based Drug Design (FBDD)

## Purpose
Design and analyze fragment libraries, compute ligand efficiency metrics,
perform fragment docking, and execute fragment-to-lead elaboration
(growing, linking, merging) with computational support.

## When to Use This Skill
- Building or filtering a fragment library
- Computing LE/LLE/LLEAT efficiency metrics
- Docking fragments into a target (weak binding, requires special settings)
- Growing a fragment hit toward lead-like compounds
- Merging two fragment hits sharing a common substructure
- Analyzing X-ray fragment screening data

## Quick Routing

**"Build a fragment library"** → `fragment-library.md`

**"Dock fragments into my target"** → `fragment-docking.md`

**"I have a fragment hit, want to grow it"** → `fragment-growing.md`

**"Track efficiency as I optimize"** → `efficiency-metrics.md`

**"What makes a good fragment?"** → `fbdd-theory.md`

## Core Concept: Rule of 3

| Property | Fragment (Ro3) | Lead-like | Drug-like (Ro5) |
|----------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
| MW | ≤ 300 Da | ≤ 400 Da | ≤ 500 Da |
| cLogP | ≤ 3 | ≤ 4 | ≤ 5 |
| HBD | ≤ 3 | ≤ 4 | ≤ 5 |
| HBA | ≤ 3 | ≤ 8 | ≤ 10 |
| PSA | — | ≤ 120 Å² | — |
| Rotatable bonds | ≤ 3 | ≤ 7 | ≤ 10 |

## Minimal LE Calculation

```python
def ligand_efficiency(pIC50, n_heavy_atoms):
    """LE = ΔG / HAC ≈ 1.37 * pIC50 / HAC (kcal/mol per heavy atom)"""
    return 1.37 * pIC50 / n_heavy_atoms

# Good fragment: LE ≥ 0.3 kcal/mol/HA
# Drug-like optimum: LE ≥ 0.3 (maintain or improve during optimization)
```
