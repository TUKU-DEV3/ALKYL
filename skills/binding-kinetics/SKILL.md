# Binding Kinetics

## Purpose
Analyze, predict, and optimize drug-target binding kinetics:
on-rates (kon), off-rates (koff), residence time (RT = 1/koff),
thermodynamic signatures (ΔH/ΔS), and structure-kinetics relationships (SKR).

## When to Use This Skill
- Analyzing SPR sensorgrams (Biacore/Sierra)
- Fitting ITC thermograms for ΔH/ΔS/ΔG
- Computing residence time from MD simulations (τRAMD, metadynamics)
- Building QSAR models for koff/kon
- Interpreting kinetic selectivity vs equilibrium selectivity
- Prioritizing compounds by residence time, not just KD

## Quick Routing

**"Fit my SPR data"** → `spr-analysis.md`

**"Fit my ITC experiment"** → `itc-analysis.md`

**"Compute residence time from MD"** → `residence-time-md.md`

**"Build a model to predict koff"** → `kinetic-qsar.md`

**"Why does my drug work despite poor KD?"** → `kinetics-theory.md`

## Key Relationships

```python
# Core kinetic relationships
KD = koff / kon                    # M (equilibrium dissociation constant)
pKD = -log10(KD)                   # analogous to pIC50
RT = 1 / koff                      # seconds (residence time)
t_half = ln(2) / koff              # seconds (half-life of complex)

# Thermodynamics
ΔG = RT_gas * ln(KD)               # kcal/mol (RT_gas = 0.592 at 298K)
ΔG = ΔH - T*ΔS                    # enthalpy-entropy decomposition

# Typical drug ranges
# kon:  10^4 – 10^7 M^-1 s^-1
# koff: 10^-5 – 10^-1 s^-1
# KD:   nM – µM
# RT:   10 s – 10^5 s (hours)
